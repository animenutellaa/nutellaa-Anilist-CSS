# nutellaa-Anilist-CSS

This is where i'll add the code i used for my [AniList Profile](https://anilist.co/user/nutellaa/).

There are small comments next to most parts of the code that say what it does to help but if you need any help with anything or have any questions, you can find my discord and other socials in my [anilist bio](https://anilist.co/user/nutellaa/).

**Main Changes**
- Changed the whole banner area including avatar, follow button and the top navbar.
- Changed the whole content area(2nd navbar/bio/activity etc.) with many features such as hover and alot of animations.
- Changed the footer and scrollbar.
- Changed the social section by adding
- Added overlay for socials (ty cakes).
- Changed up the font in some areas.
- Added user badges for some users that send messages.

(btw i update my css frequently with more changes to make it better so the one you see below is not the final one, as i get better at this i will probably add more code)

ty [chrisenpai](https://anilist.co/user/ChriSenpai/) and [cakes](https://anilist.co/user/cakes/) for helping out, also ty [anzu](https://anilist.co/user/Anzu/) and [sigma](https://anilist.co/user/Sigma/) for some of the code I used and modified.
