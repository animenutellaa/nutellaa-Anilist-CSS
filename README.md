# nutellaa-Anilist-CSS

If you are familiar with css, im sure you can figure out what different parts of the code do.

But if you need any help with anything or have any questions, you can find my discord and other socials in my [anilist bio](https://anilist.co/user/nutellaa/).

(btw i update my css frequently with more changes to make it better so the one you see below is not the final one, as i get better at this i will probably add more code)

ty @/chrisenpai and @/cakes for helping out, also ty @/anzu for some of the code i used

What my current CSS looks like before and after![nutellaa's profile Â· AniList - Google Chrome 17_04_2021 06_58_42](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82683011/115103546-899b8880-9f4a-11eb-8632-d3a4b3e586df.png)

Ofcourse there are animations and other features on different parts throughout my profile that cant be seen with just a scrrenshot ^^
